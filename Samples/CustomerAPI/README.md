MvaAzureWebSites
================

All the code, samples and presentations for the MVA sessions covering Windows Azure Web Sites with Tejaswi Redkar and James Chambers.

The Customer API demo with Windows 8 Notifications is based on the original work of Cory Fowler and the Hands on Lab content in the Windows Azure Training Kit. I have revamped it for MVC 5, Twitter's Bootstrap library and made use of Azure Web Site configuration settings to store otherwise sensative information like connection strings.
