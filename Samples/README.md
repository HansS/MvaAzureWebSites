================

All the code, samples and presentations for the MVA sessions covering Windows Azure Web Sites Jump Start Deep Dive with Tejaswi Redkar and James Chambers.  

The sessions were recorded live in Redmond on Dec 11, 2013. While the information was accurate and the samples were working at the time of recording, Windows Azure is a living machine that is changing/growing/reshaping as it goes. If you have any questions please feel free to ask!
